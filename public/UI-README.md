    --secondary-color: #64748b;
    --success-color: #10b981;
    --error-color: #ef4444;
    /* ... more variables */
}
```

### API Configuration
Update the API base URL in `script.js`:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3000/api';
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **UI not loading**: Ensure the API server is running on port 3000
2. **Login issues**: Check API credentials and network connectivity
3. **Payment failures**: Verify API payment processing is working correctly
4. **Materials not accessible**: Ensure user is registered for the course

### Development Mode
- Open browser Developer Tools (F12) for debugging
- Check Console for JavaScript errors
- Check Network tab for API request/response details
